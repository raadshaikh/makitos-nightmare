For Windows: double-click 'mnGame.exe'.
For others, use the source code 'mnGame.py' however you like. 'spritesheet.py' will need to be in the same directory, though.
(The 'res' folder is needed in both cases.)

This is a simple, defensive bullet hell-style game.

Avoid the raindrops. The longer you last, the more points you get. When your health runs out, game over.

Arrow keys to move in four directions. Z to use an umbrella, which guards against rain for awhile. Sometimes an umbrella falls from the sky, grabbing it will add to your umbrella stockpile.
X to pause, and ESC to quit anytime.
